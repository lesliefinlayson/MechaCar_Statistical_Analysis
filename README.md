## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Goal:  using linear regression, determine what metrics affect vehicle performance, as measured by vehicle's mpg.

_Variables/coefficients that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset_

This is determined by looking at the individual variable p-values.  In the summary output, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model.
